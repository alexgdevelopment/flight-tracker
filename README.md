## Project Description

### Goal

This is a Vue2 project that showcases implementation of basic principles in development concerning Vuex and Jest. Also practiced are the Nuxt package and the Vuetify component library.

As the name suggests, it offers the user the option to find a specific flight. They can search either by flight number or by the arrival/departure airport and the date.
